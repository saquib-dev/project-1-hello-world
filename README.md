# Simple Hello World App

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400/007bff/ffffff?text=Hello+World+Project)

### A foundational full-stack application to demonstrate basic client-server communication.

This project is a perfect starting point for anyone new to full-stack development. It showcases a simple architecture where a frontend built with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** fetches a greeting message from a backend API created using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It’s a great example of how these two layers work together to deliver content.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Backend**: A lightweight **Node.js** server with **Express.js** that exposes a `/api/hello` endpoint.
-   **Frontend**: A simple webpage that makes an API call and displays the response.
-   **Static Serving**: Serves the frontend files directly from the Express server.
-   **Responsive Design**: The simple CSS ensures the app looks good on any screen size.
